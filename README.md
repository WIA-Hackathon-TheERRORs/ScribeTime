# ScribeTime
Long Desccription - :

A lot of visually impaired students or students who can not write their own exams due to any kind of physical disability or temporary problem, like fracture, face challenges in finding people who can write exams for them. Many times, they are forced to pay huge amounts also for getting their exams written. Our web application , c/a ScribeTime, helps these students in finding volunteers for writing their exam. 

### Registration & Verification

Both the volunteers and students(or someone or some NGO on their behalf) can register on ScribeTime. The application should be intelligent enough to verify that student is a genuine case, using disabilty certificate provided by the student . The volunteers need to enter the languages they can write exam in. The volunteer should also be able to speak in those languages. For volunteer , his GOV Id and educational qualification verification should be done through application. The application should also be able to evaluate the proficiency of the volunteer in the langauages registered  during registration. Once registration is complete, users can login into their accounts on the website.

### Request Process Flow

1. Student can raise request giving the exam details like venue, date ,time , language required etc. 
2. The application will try to find the best suitable candidates who can write the exam requested by the student. The search algorithm for finding best suitable candidates should take into consideration the language required in the exam (whether the volunteer can speak and write in that language), the distance of the exam venue from the volunteer's current location (requests will be sent to only those volunteers within a threshold distance) and the educational qualification of the volunteer.The application also takes into account the past requests and help to provide a personalised search for the Students. The application will then send a SMS notifcation to all such applicable volunteers. 
3. The volunteers can visit the website and accept or reject the request, according to their availability. 
4. Volunteer can  see all  pending requests and accepted requests and their info on the website. 
5. Whenever a request is accepted, a SMS notification is send to the respective student also that his request got accepted. 
6. Student can visit the volunteer's profile to check his basic information and contact the volunteer.
7. Student can see his past open and accepted requests and their info on the website. 
8. The application will help the student in finding a volunteer. After that its the responsibilty of the student(or the person or organisation registering on his/her behalf) to take the required permissions from the exam organising committee.
